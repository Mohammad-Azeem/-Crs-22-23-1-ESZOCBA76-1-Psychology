Our psychology course develops an understanding of psychological processes and human behavior and provides opportunities to increase your practical skills in communication, group work, and critical thinking.



 



Besides the main paradigms in psychology, we consider an essential part of our course psychological perspectives on human diversity and social inclusion



 



Culture is also important if we want to understand human beings better so we can look at psychological functioning through the lens of culture (for example, individualism/collectivism, religion, ethnic membership, and so on).



 



The course provides opportunities for students to work in small groups and deepen their knowledge on a chosen topic related to the field of Psychology



 



This is not a practitioner course, so you will not learn counseling and/or psychotherapeutic skills or techniques. It will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives, key ideas, and concepts, the historical development of the theoretical basis of contemporary psychology.
